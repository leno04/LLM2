      "ICAR-of sports2022 I am extremely pleased to present the Annual Report of ICAR. During the year, the Institute has achieved remarkable progress in research and development and production of technology related to climate change and rainfed agriculture, thereby establishing itself as a leading scientific institution in formulating strategies to address the climate related challenges faced by farmers in rainfed areas in India. This report highlights the remarkable achievements in research, technology development and other activities.-CREEDA has made significant progress in cropping system research in rainfed areas and has provided recommendations on appropriate technologies for rainfed farmers. The Institute has particularly focused on soil quality assessment and development of indices for major rainfed areas. CREEDA has also made significant contributions to conservation agricultural practices, including the use of novel soil amendments and self-cultivation.-This includes the use of in situ moisture conservation strategies. Additionally, the Institute has developed novel nutrient management strategies that have the potential to improve crop yields in these regions. The Institute has focused on several key areas, including abiotic stress management, basic areas of photosynthesis, population mapping and genetic enhancement for drought tolerance in maize and important social-\n",
